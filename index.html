    <p>I am web developer. I was once a wayward child
        running the streets of New Orleans and getting into all kinds of trouble. I joined
        the United States Army as a Human Resources Specialist at the age of 18 and made some changes for the better. I
        was
        honorably discharged after becoming a mother. I did some customer service work but
        felt no inspiration. One day a stumbled upon some coding information and I felt like
        Neo in The Matrix. I had to follow the white rabbit. And here I am now, passionately
        coding like my life depends on it!!!

As a user, I would like to view a series of data related to the site owners interest so that the I can quickly view more
information about them.
Create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML. Some ideas that you can include could be
top ten movies, top ten favorite places, or top ten places to visit. You may choose to do whatever top ten list that you
wish.
Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML
As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses so that I can learn more about
the site owner.
Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.
As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with
with a guessing game.
Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.
As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.
Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions
asked.
Using Lighthouse in the Chrome DevTools, analyze the accessibility of your application.

Strive for a score between 50-65. Make necessary adjustments based on the report to achieve that score.
Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md file.
In addition to the user stories stated above, continue to use console.logs throughout the code to track the questions
that are being asked to the user, and add addtional CSS to style your HTML page.

Stay within scope of what was taught so far in class. Do not write functions within your application. Avoid the use of
“helper” methods such as .includes() and .join(). Work with the instructional staff directly if you have questions about
this requirement.
